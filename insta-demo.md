This option is not production-ready. If you want to evaluate Pulp in a quick and easy way, you can use the `pulp-insta-demo.sh` script.

This [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pulp/pulp-operator/master/insta-demo/pulp-insta-demo.sh) installs [K3s Lightweight Kubernetes](https://k3s.io/) and then deploys the Pulp operator.

Pulp operator is under active development. This page will be updated to reflect any updated features or change of status.
