The Pulp 3 CLI is under active development.

The Pulp 3 CLI has been designed with a plugin structure, meaning that it is implemented by plugin writers on a per-plugin basis.

After you install Pulp, you can then install the Pulp 3 CLI by following the [Pulp 3 CLI Quickstart guide](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_cli/quickstart.html).

You can find some example commands in the Quickstart. Where the Pulp 3 CLI has been implemented, you can find Pulp 3 CLI example workflows in the corresponding plugin documentation.

For example, you can find Pulp 3 CLI commands for the following Pulp Python workflows in the Pulp Python docs:

* [Creating a distribution](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_python/workflows/pypi.html#create-a-distribution)
* [Syncing a repository](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_python/workflows/sync.html)
* [Creating and uploading to a repostory](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_python/workflows/upload.html)
* [Creating and hosting a publication](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_python/workflows/publish.html)

For a list of plugin coverage, see **a-note-on-pulp-3-cli-coverage** on the [content plugins](/content-plugins/) homepage.
