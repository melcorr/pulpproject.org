This installation option has more manual steps than the other available options. After the installation, you must perform further configuration steps. You must also install the PostgreSQL and Redis, and then configure Systemd. The [Ansible Installer](/ansible-installer/) does all of this for you.

With this option, you can install Pulpcore using `pip` or from [source](https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore.git).

For more information, see [PyPi Installation documentation](https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/master/nightly/installation/instructions.html#pypi-installation).
