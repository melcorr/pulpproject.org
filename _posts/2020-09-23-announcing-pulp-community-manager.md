Hello,

You might have seen my name popping up on the Pulp blog or on the mailing list. I want to take some time to introduce myself.

For the last number of years, on top of their engineering work, Brian Bouterse and Ina Panova had led all Pulp community related activities. At the end of last year, the Foreman and Pulp communities put out a call looking for a full-time community manager to work across both teams. Since April, I’ve been working with Brian and Ina to take over the community-related aspects of Pulp so that they can focus full time on their engineering duties. I've also been working in the Foreman community.

In the Foreman community, I have some set tasks like running community demos, writing the newsletter, as well as unblocking community members and making sure that people get answers to their questions on a daily basis. This summer, I was involved in the organization of Foreman's very first online birthday celebration. When the world returns to normal, I will also be responsible for organizing Foreman and Pulp's presence at conferences. For both the Foreman and Pulp communities, I am particularly interested in lowering the barrier of entry for new users. For Pulp, which does not have a web UI or Pulp 3 CLI, the barrier for entry can be quite high.

As a start, I’ve been working on building out the web content on this site so that new and existing Pulp users can find the information they need. I’m committed to making the Pulp blog an up-to-date source of information related to Pulp. There, I will endeavour to post information related to Pulp releases and roadmaps, as well as requests for community feedback for different ideas and proof of concepts that the Pulp team are working on. I’ve also started putting together monthly summaries of all releases and discussions going on in the Pulp community. Pulp has a small community, and because of this, I’ll be paying attention to ways of enhancing the channels of communication so that people can find us and get the information they need. If you have any ideas about how I could extend this, let me know!

During the Pulp team’s first ever virtual PulpCon, I was delighted to meet community members who dropped by to say hello and tell the Pulp team about their experiences using Pulp. The Pulp team and I are interested in developing more ways to establish open communication like this with our community members. While a 2020 of travel restrictions has meant that we have not had the opportunity to meet in person, PulpCon 2020 showed us how there are advantages to hosting open meetings in a virtual space where community members can drop by and tell us their experiences. If you weren’t able to attend, you can watch the [sessions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwm8_O6oKSS1G6XPS8n0udXd8UD9hqdK5) on Pulp’s YouTube. If nothing else, you should check out the wide array of hats that the team owns!

Brian and Ina, as well as the wider Pulp team, have been very generous with their time and knowledge as I get up to speed with Pulp as a project as well as the needs and concerns of the Pulp community. I would like to thank the entire Pulp team for their patience and generosity over the last few months.

The team is always hoping to hear from you, either on the `pulp-list@redhat.com` or on the `#pulp` channel on Freenode IRC.

Feel free to reach out to and say hi  at `mcorr` on Freenode IRC. I am based in Cork, Ireland.
